## Overview

- This project is inteded to serve as a weather app which displays both the current temperature of a city and also a five day forcast of the weather within that same city. There are three hour intervals between the different temperatures of a given city displayed.
- This project utilizes Typescript in coordination with the React Library and Yarn part of the NodeJS structure to build and run the application

## API Calls
1. This application uses the https://openweathermap.org/ REST API to request weather and forcast information based on the given city name or zip code.
* THE API KEY SHOWN IN PREVIOUS COMMITS WAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION PURPOSES AND HAS BEEN DEPRECATED

# Initial Set Up

*You will need an API key for local development
* Once you have your API key, create a .env file within the root directory and store it as a string with the variable REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY
* Make sure you have NodeJS installed and Yarn specifically, (project could possibly work with npm, but this has not been tested) 
* Prior to starting react appliation, run yarn install to install all needed dependancies

## How To Run

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
